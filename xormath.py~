Concept of xormath Author: aubinh

Concept: Xor encryption is a simple encryption that takes the "difference" between bits.
using xor encryption requres a message and a key. If you are decrypting, you need to find the key in order to
decrypt the message. This method looks for known file signature headers and xor's them with the encrypted
text. This then creates a key. Using this key you are able to decrypt the  rest of the file.

The reason this works so well is due to the fact of XORd data not changing the "difference" between bytes
meaning: If you have x45 and x47, then xor them with a random key, they will always be x02 apart. This code
looks for those differences of file signatures. Then determines the key.
